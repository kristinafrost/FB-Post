![screenshot] (/Week1_hw5.gif?raw=true "GIF")

Took 20 hours to complete.

Completed features:
	
Added a container view and modified the properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
Added buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
Added UIImageViews
Added UILabels with attributed text
Added Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears
Partially Added Optional: Implement the same page programatically without using Interface Builder
(everything was programmatically added except the following: like, comment, and share buttons. The tap gesture recognizer, and making the link clickable using a button overlayed.)

Uncompleted features:

Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable
I had issues getting this to work. In my terminal it says that CocoaPods are read-only. Can we take a look at this next class?

Optional: Configure the autoresizingMasks to support rotation
